The Library Management System project is a simple Python implementation of a system that manages books and members in a library using 
object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The project consists of three main classes: Book, Library, and Member.

Book Class:

Represents a book with attributes such as title, author, ISBN, and availability status.
The __str__ method provides a formatted string representation of the book.

Library Class:

Manages a collection of books.
Provides methods to add books, display the library catalog, and search for books.

Member Class:

Represents a library member with a name and a list of borrowed books.
It allows members to borrow and return books.
The Library Management System demonstrates basic interactions like adding books to the library, displaying the catalog, searching for books, 
and allowing members to borrow and return books. The availability status of each book is tracked through the available attribute, ensuring 
proper management of book lending within the system.
